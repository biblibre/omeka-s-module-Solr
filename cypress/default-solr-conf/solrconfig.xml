  <!-- Data Directory

       Used to specify an alternate directory to hold all index data

       wraps solr.StandardDirectoryFactory and caches small files in memory
       for better NRT performance.

       One can force a particular implementation via solr.MMapDirectoryFactory,
       solr.NIOFSDirectoryFactory, or solr.SimpleFSDirectoryFactory.

       solr.RAMDirectoryFactory is memory based and not persistent.

  <!-- The CodecFactory for defining the format of the inverted index.
       The default implementation is SchemaCodecFactory, which is the official Lucene
       index format, but hooks into the schema to provide per-field customization of
       the postings lists and per-document values in the fieldType element
       (postingsFormat/docValuesFormat). Note that most of the alternative implementations
       are experimental, so if you choose to customize the index format, it's a good
       idea to convert back to the official format e.g. via IndexWriter.addIndexes(IndexReader)
       before upgrading to a newer version to avoid unnecessary reindexing.
       A "compressionMode" string element can be added to <codecFactory> to choose
       between the existing compression modes in the default codec: "BEST_SPEED" (default)
       or "BEST_COMPRESSION".

                  another process trying to modify the index.
         native = NativeFSLockFactory - uses OS native file locking.
                  Do not use when multiple solr webapps in the same
                  JVM are attempting to share a single index.

         Perform a hard commit automatically under certain conditions.
         Instead of enabling autoCommit, consider using "commitWithin"
         when adding documents.

         http://wiki.apache.org/solr/UpdateXmlMessages

         maxDocs - Maximum number of documents to add since the last
                   commit before automatically triggering a new commit.

         maxTime - Maximum amount of time in ms that is allowed to pass
                   since a document was added before automatically
                   triggering a new commit.
         openSearcher - if false, the commit causes recent index changes
           to be flushed to stable storage, but does not cause a new
           searcher to be opened to make those changes visible.

         If the updateLog is enabled, then it's highly recommended to
         have some sort of hard autoCommit to limit the log size.

    <!-- Solr Internal Query Caches

         There are four implementations of cache available for Solr:
         LRUCache, based on a synchronized LinkedHashMap, 
         LFUCache and FastLRUCache, based on a ConcurrentHashMap, and CaffeineCache -
         a modern and robust cache implementation. Note that in Solr 9.0
         only CaffeineCache will be available, other implementations are now
         deprecated.

         FastLRUCache has faster gets and slower puts in single
         threaded operation and thus is generally faster than LRUCache
         when the hit ratio of the cache is high (> 75%), and may be
         faster under other scenarios on multi-cpu systems.
         Starting with Solr 9.0 the default cache implementation used is CaffeineCache.
    -->

    <!-- Filter Cache

         Cache used by SolrIndexSearcher for filters (DocSets),
         unordered sets of *all* documents that match a query.  When a
         new searcher is opened, its caches may be prepopulated or
         "autowarmed" using data from caches in the old searcher.
         autowarmCount is the number of items to prepopulate.  For
         LRUCache, the autowarmed items will be the most recently
         accessed items.

         Parameters:
           class - the SolrCache implementation LRUCache or
               (LRUCache or FastLRUCache)
           size - the maximum number of entries in the cache
           initialSize - the initial capacity (number of entries) of
               the cache.  (see java.util.HashMap)
           autowarmCount - the number of entries to prepopulate from
               an old cache.
           maxRamMB - the maximum amount of RAM (in MB) that this cache is allowed
                      to occupy. Note that when this option is specified, the size
                      and initialSize parameters are ignored.

         this cache will not be autowarmed.

    <!-- Field Value Cache

         Cache used to hold field values that are quickly accessible

         Example of a generic cache.  These caches may be accessed by
         name through SolrIndexSearcher.getCache(),cacheLookup(), and
         cacheInsert().  The purpose is to enable easy caching of
         user/application level data.  The regenerator argument should
         be specified as an implementation of solr.CacheRegenerator
         if autowarming is desired.

         requests matching documents 10 through 19, and queryWindowSize is 50,
         then documents 0 through 49 will be collected and cached.  Any further
